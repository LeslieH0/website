		<p>I am a student at UTSA double majoring in Physics and Computer Science. I was born in Mexico but grew up in San Anotnio from the young age of about three years old. With my degrees I intend to pursue a career as either a Physics professor or a video game designer. I attained a diploma from High School at Jefferson High School with electives in computer animation and Orchestra. Now I'm focusing on raising my GPA by taking my pre-requisites at SAC. Ever since I was small science has fascinated me, capturing my attention and allowing me to better understand the workings of the universe on both a grand and miniscule scale.</p>

			After I graduate, I aspire to earn a career in cybersecurity. With cybersecurity as my job I would be able to make use of my double major. With my salary I'd own a new car and a house or an apartment. There are many courses for me to take as a computer scientist and I choose to protect computers from malware. In addition to working in cybersecurity, I intend to earn a blackbelt in Hapkido while I independently research Physics. While I do enjoy computer science, Physics is a passion of mine and the field of quantum physics in particular has enthralled me. Other fields of study which I took upon myself to research by myself are Calculus, Statistics and Probability, and Psychology.
